A kiosk-style web app to load in a "magic mirror" to display current family-related information such as calendars, MOTD, chores, etc. 

A magic mirror is a monitor or smart device running behind a two-way mirror, so that the end result is text seemingly floating over one's own reflection. You can see a common implementation at [Lifehacker](http://lifehacker.com/build-a-magic-mirror-with-a-raspberry-pi-and-an-old-mon-1750468358)

The current stack on my magic mirror is a Rails backend with a full React frontend.
